# Sotoudeh's Laboratory Information System (FBS Full Edition)

This LIS (Laboratory Information System) is designed for laboratory managers and individuals who want to understand their blood test results.

## Overview

Blood Test Analyzer helps analyze FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar) data, considering various factors that can affect the results, such as:
- A1C (average blood sugar levels over the last three months)
- FBS history
- Medications
- Symptoms
- Hormone deficiencies
- Age
- Cortisol levels
- Smoking history

These factors can cause fluctuations in FBS levels, making manual examination time-consuming and prone to human error. This application allows medical professionals to upload a CSV file with patient test results, navigate through the data, and see automated analysis. They can also modify the analysis results and send them to their secretary to share with patients.

## Features

- Upload and process CSV files of patient test results
- Automated analysis of FBS data
- Manual editing of analysis results
- Generate and share reports
